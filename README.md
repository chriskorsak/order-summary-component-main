## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned that I need more practice developing a website from a jpg design mockup file! It's great practice to see something and then code it to match.

### Continued development

I am going to continue developing with a mobile-first approach to CSS.

### Useful resources

- [Flexbox Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - I almost always consult CSS Tricks guide to flexbox when using this layout method.
- [GH-Pages Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-pages) - Helpful to deploy to github pages.
